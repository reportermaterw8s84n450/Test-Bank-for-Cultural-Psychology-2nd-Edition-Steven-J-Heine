  * Steven Heine is one of the leading figures in the field of cultural psychology. In addition to presenting the importance of culture to the study of behavior, Cultural Psychology, Second Edition, has a strong emphasis on research methodology, which comes out of in-depth discussions of select topics and studies in each chapter―encouraging students to understand common behaviors in different cultures. Heine builds the text around the most enduring questions in the field of psychology and shows how cultural psychology is providing insights into our understanding of them.
